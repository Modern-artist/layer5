Badges are how users demonstrate their prowress with the projects and how contributors identify their ownership, dedication, skills and communi to Layer5. There are several badges each representing a specific user achievement or contributor skill.

Layer5 Badges are a tangible way for us to recognize and honor the exceptional efforts put forth by our contributors and the milestones achieved by our users. These badges are a symbol of your dedication, commitment, and passion for making a positive impact within the Layer5 community and projects.
